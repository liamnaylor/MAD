All endpoints implemented (GET user details and view single post displayed as alerts)

The draft extension was attempted however not completed and only saves text to an array in JSON
format.

eslint has been used to enforce the code styling and JS Standard has been used as a styling guide,
there are however several elements that cannot styled as it would require user_id and post_id to 
be declared as variables rather than objects for use. 

The eslint Visual Studio Code extension was used to automatically scan through the code to format.

NOTE: THE DECLINE FRIEND REQUEST FUNCTION IS WORKING PROPERLY HOWEVER FORGOT TO SHOW ON THE SCREENCAST.
